# Keyboard Belgian macOS 
 
Layout generated with ukelele app.

I created this config because i've a basic keyboard and the keylayouts already present are not what i expect. (Belgian or AzertyR03).
This layout is not accurate and need to be improved. 

To install it, you have just to unzip and launch the bundle or put the .keylayout or the bundle file into one of the following folders `~Library/Keyboard Layouts` or `~/Users/{user}/Library/Keyboard Layouts`

### Todo
 - [x] put the accent automatically on when you type an accent followed by a vowel
 - [] fix maj tab shift shortcut to navigate into opnened applications (maj tab work well)
