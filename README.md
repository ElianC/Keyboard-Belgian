# Keyboard Belgian macOS 
 
Layout generated with ukelele app.

I created this config because i've a basic keyboard and the keylayouts already present are not what i expect. (Belgian or AzertyR03
This layout is not accurate and need to be improved. 

To install it, you have just to unzip and launch the bundle or put the .keylayout file in folder `~Library/Keyboard Layouts` or `~/Users/{user}/Library/Keyboard Layouts`
